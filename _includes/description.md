# Introduction
This is the very beginning of my musings about [Android Things](https://developer.android.com/things/hardware/index.html). You can also find me blogging on [Placona.co.uk](https://www.placona.co.uk), writing security articles on [AndroidSecurity.info](https://www.androidsecurity.info) or on [Twilio's Blog](https://www.twilio.com/blog). 

The idea with this website is to keep it as an up-to-date resource for all IoT related subjects on Android Things.
